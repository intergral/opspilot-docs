## FusionReactor Cloud is now OpsPilot

**Published: March 9, 2026**

FusionReactor Cloud is officially becoming **OpsPilot**.

Your account, pricing, integrations, and support team remain exactly as they were. What's changing is the identity of the platform - and for good reason.

OpsPilot has been the AI engine at the heart of the product for the past three years. As the platform grew to proactively guide teams, score stack health, investigate incidents, and deliver prioritised recommendations, it became clear that OpsPilot wasn't just a feature. It was the product. The rename reflects that reality.

### What's new in this release

Alongside the rebrand, this is the biggest UI update in FusionReactor's history:

- **Fully refreshed interface** - Modern, unified, and designed for clarity
- **Side navigation** - Faster and more intuitive product navigation
- **Full mobile and tablet support** - The navigation is now fully responsive
- **Multi-tenancy built in** - Seamless switching between multiple organisations
- **New homepage** - Clear summaries, current statuses, and onboarding guidance
- **Alerting engine front and centre** - Easier to configure, monitor, and act on alerts
- **Improved Servers view** - Now the default view, with real-time and historic data side by side and built-in crash protection analysis
- **OpsPilot AI throughout the product** - AI-powered chat and analysis accessible from anywhere in the product

!!! note
    To get the most out of these new features, we recommend upgrading to the **FusionReactor Agent 2025.2** release.

### What comes next

The roadmap for 2026 is anchored around AI and OpenTelemetry - deeper AI-powered investigation and root cause analysis, broader OpenTelemetry support across languages and frameworks, and more intelligence built into every layer of the product.

### FusionReactor 2025.2.1 released

- Added support for Jersey classes that use Jakarta  (e.g. ColdFusion REST) while also prevent errors.
- Fixed bug found when JDBC PreparedStatements have an odd number of quote characters (`'`) in comments
- Fixed potential XSS exploit in UI.
- Added HTTPS support, in the on-prem UI, for later versions of Java.
- Prevents out-of-date metric labels.

### FusionReactor 2025.2.0 released 

- Support for OTLP data format allowing the export of FusionReactor data to any OTLP data ingest (Metrics, Logs, and Traces).
- Crash Protection alerts in cloud adding improved clarity and analysis.
- Added OpsPilot integration within the on-prem UI tunnel in cloud for AI analysis.
- New colour themes for FusionReactor's on-prem UI.
- Support for Lucee 7 installation via FRAM.
- Updated version of the JRE bundled with FRAM (8u472) and other security updates within FusionReactor.



!!! Warning
    If you are upgrading to **FusionReactor 2025.2** and are already using **OTel**, FusionReactor will now automatically use any existing configured endpoints. To ensure you continue receiving data in **FusionReactor Cloud** while using an OTel Collector, you must update your `collector.yaml` configuration file. Please refer to the [documentation linked here](https://docs.fusionreactor.io/Monitor-your-data/FR-Agent/Configuration/OTel-shipping-config/) for the required changes.
